# Digital-Signal-Processing--Correlation
## AIM:
To generate discrete auto correlation and cross correlation of signals using MATLAB.
## APPARATUS REQUIRED:
MATLAB R2012.
## ALGORITHM:
Step 1: Open matlab. Write the program.

Step 2: Read the input sequence 1 and input sequence 2 sequence.

Step 3: Perform auto correlation and cross correlation for both the sequences. 

Step 4: Plot the output sequence with x-label and y-label with suitable title.

Step 5: Terminate the program.
